    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>Create a workout of favorite exercises and assign them a value.</p>
    <p>You start with a balance of 0 points. Every night, we deduct 100.</p>
    <p>Do one of your exercises and log it to earn points against your balance.</p>
    <p>If you keep a positive balance, you're on a streak. Fall below 0 and you break it.</p>
    <p>Every night we'll send you an email to remind you.</p>
